- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jackbann

I am physically located in Canada, so I could help anyone to host your code, so you can keep anonymous. 

If you need my help, please create a issue in [this repo](https://github.com/jackbann/jackbann) **anonymously**, with the following information: 

1. Your **temporary** email address. 
2. Your PGP public key ID. 

And I will talk to you via email. My PGP public key ID is 2F851C08C9684572BC83816F5EF67DB6AFD44A68, and **do not trust any unsigned email**. 

Your repo must be legal in Canada, and your open source license should not (and could not) force others to keep author information.
